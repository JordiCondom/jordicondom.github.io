I am a PhD student within the [National PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Society](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/) at the University of Pisa, and a member of the [Cyber Intelligence Research Unit](https://cyb.iit.cnr.it/en/) at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR). I am also a member of the [Complex Human Behaviour Lab (CHub)](https://chub.fbk.eu/) from Fondazione Bruno Kessler.

My research focuses on issues such as the spread of mis/dis/malinformation, and hate speech, as well as exploring effective ways to address and mitigate these challenges.
