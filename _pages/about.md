I am a PhD student within the [National PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Society](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/) at the University of Pisa, and a member of the [Cyber Intelligence Research Unit](https://cyb.iit.cnr.it/en/) at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR). I am also a member of the [Complex Human Behaviour Lab (CHub)](https://chub.fbk.eu/) from Fondazione Bruno Kessler.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on understanding and mitigating pervasive and harmful content on social media platforms, particularly hate speech and mis/dis/mal-information. I investigate whether, and how, computational approaches, methods, and interventions can contribute to making online spaces safer and more inclusive for everyone.

When I'm offline, I am probably watching birds.
